# Mock Mode Configuration
# This configuration runs the canary system with mock providers (no API costs)
# Suitable for frequent validation (every few minutes) and CI/CD pipelines

# Mode: mock or real
mode: mock

# Agent configuration
agent:
  agent_id: canary_mock_001
  agent_name: Mock Canary Agent

# Mock-specific settings
mock_settings:
  # Simulated LLM latency in milliseconds
  llm_latency_ms: 500
  
  # Simulated tool execution latency in milliseconds
  tool_latency_ms: 200
  
  # Tool failure rate (0.0 = never fail, 1.0 = always fail)
  # Set to 0.0 for normal scenarios, increase for failure testing
  tool_failure_rate: 0.0

# OpenTelemetry configuration
otlp:
  # OTLP collector endpoint
  # Use localhost for local development, or service name in Docker/K8s
  endpoint: http://localhost:4317
  
  # Whether to use insecure connection (true for development)
  insecure: true

# Scenarios to execute (in order)
scenarios:
  - simple_tool_call
  - multi_tool_chain
  - tool_failure
  - high_token_usage
  - conversation_context
  - multi_agent

# Telemetry validation (optional)
# If provided, the canary will validate that telemetry appears in the stack
validation:
  # Prometheus URL for metrics validation
  prometheus_url: http://localhost:9090
  
  # OpenSearch URL for traces/logs validation
  opensearch_url: https://localhost:9200
  
  # OpenSearch credentials
  # Use environment variables for sensitive values
  opensearch_user: admin
  opensearch_password: ${OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD}
